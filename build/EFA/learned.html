<TR><TD>We are committed to delivering the best protection possible against undesirable
        email content including spam and viruses. The simple action of reporting this
        message as spam helps us achieve this by treating similar messages with greater
        suspicion in future.<br>
        <br>
        Please continue to report any messages which you believe to be spam in this way. <br>
        <br>
        Although you will not receive any further update about this spam message,
        the anti-spam system has already been automatically updated to treat similar messages with
        more suspicion in future. This will reduce the likelihood of you or others receiving them
        again. <br>
        <br>
        Reporting this message will not automatically block all messages from this sender - if you want
        to do this you should add the sender to your blacklist.<BR>
        If the message you just reported is from a mailing list you subscribed to, please unsubscribe
        from the mailing list rather than report the messages as spam (reporting mailing list messages
        as spam will have a negative effect on people who <i> want </i> to receive these messages).<BR>
        Please see the user guide or contact your email administrator for further instructions.
