# ClamAV Unofficial Signature Databases Update Cron File
#
# Author: Bill Landry <unofficialsigs@gmail.com>
#
# This cron file will execute the clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh script that
# currently supports updating third-party signature databases provided
# by Sanesecurity, SecuriteInfo, MalwarePatrol, OITC, etc.
#
# The script is set to run hourly, at 45 minutes past the hour, and the 
# script itself is set to randomize the actual execution time between
# 60 - 600 seconds.  Adjust the cron start time, user account to run the
# script under, and path information shown below to meet your own needs.
