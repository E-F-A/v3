E.F.A stands for Email Filter Appliance.
E.F.A is born out of a need for a cost-effective email virus & spam scanning solution after the ESVA project died.

We try to create a complete package using existing open-source anti-spam projects and combine them to a single easy to use (virtual) appliance.

For more information go to http://www.efa-project.org & http://www.esva-community.com

E.F.A V3 is a rebuild of the previous ESVA; the same components are used whenever possible but are all updated to the latest version.
