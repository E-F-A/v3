###################### How To Update ##################################

It is recommended that you suspend your mail flow and snapshot prior
to updating or to back up the entire appliance.

1) Stop mail flow temporarily (at firewalls/mailservers)
2) Snapshot your VM and its memory using your hypervisor tools
3) If the update fails for any reason, immediately roll back to snapshot
4) Report failure at https://forum.efa-project.org

Launch EFA-Configure from console or secure shell

sudo /usr/local/sbin/EFA-Configure

Choose option 14) Update Now

The first time you run this update, the kernel may update. If this
happens, the script will halt to give you an opportunity to restart.
After restarting and booting to the new kernel, rerun EFA-Update to
continue the update process to 3.0.1.4.

EFA-Update will not proceed until you are running on the latest
kernel.  This is to ensure that open-vm-tools updates appropriately
if present.

After updating, please run "Update GeoIP Database" update as soon as
possible from MailWatch under Tools/Links.

################ Important Info -- Custom Tweaks ######################

Many EFA users have modified their EFA installations and made tweaks
that may "disappear" after an update to 3.0.1.4.

Updated files have been automatically backed up to the following
location:

/var/EFA/backup/

(Other versions may be present if updating from an older version)

You may need to re-implement customizations after update to 3.0.1.4
For example, if you are using Active Directory integration,
this will need to be turned back on (see MailWatch Changes below)

########################## Known Issues ###############################

1)  If you are running commercial VMware-Tools, open-vm-tools may
install itself after updating to 3.0.1.4.  Reapply VMware-Tools
after updating to 3.0.1.4.  Run the following command to remove
open-vm-tools:

sudo rpm -e open-vm-tools

2) Error, "could not search" when logging into MailWatch after
updating to 3.0.1.4

This occurs when Active Directory integration is enabled.

Check /var/www/html/mailscanner/conf.php

Change the following line to 'mail' from 'proxyaddresses', if needed...
define('LDAP_EMAIL_FIELD', 'proxyaddresses');

Change the following
define('LDAP_MS_AD_COMPATIBILITY', true);

3) EFA-Update hanging at end of update (logsave not exiting)

This is a known issue.  This is usually caused from processes that
spawned off of the script and have not closed.

You can kill the logsave process (Ctrl+C if running interactively)

4) WARNINGS from MailScanner upgrade

This is a known issue and is benign.  It has been reported to MailScanner
developers.

5) Updating with multiple AV Scanners present

Starting with update 3.0.1.2, MailScanner has undergone a major upgrade to v5.

One of the changes includes the introduction of a new group called "mtagroup."

You may see MailScanner failing to scan emails as a result of the upgrade or a scanning loop occurring.

If you are running any 3rd party antivirus scanners, please be sure to add the users to the mtagroup:

sudo usermod someavaccount -G mtagroup

An AV daemon restart and/or a reboot may be needed for the change to take effect.
