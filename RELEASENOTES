###################### How To Update ##################################

It is recommended that you suspend your mail flow and snapshot prior
to updating or to back up the entire appliance.

1) Stop mail flow temporarily (at firewalls/mailservers)
2) Snapshot your VM and its memory using your hypervisor tools
3) If the update fails for any reason, collect relevant logs or screen
outputs/screenshots and revert to your snapshot
4) Report failure at https://forum.efa-project.org

Launch EFA-Configure from console or secure shell

(sudo /usr/local/sbin/EFA-Configure)

Choose option 14) Update Now

The first time you run this update, the kernel may update. If this
happens, the script will halt to give you an opportunity to restart.
After restarting and booting to the new kernel, rerun EFA-Update to
continue the update process to 3.0.2.6.

EFA-Update will not proceed until you are running on the latest
kernel.  This is to ensure that open-vm-tools updates appropriately
if present.

############# Important Info -- Deprecation Warning ###################

Due to security issues found in the handling of domain admins, users
and domain admins are required to be full email addresses.  This
requirement can be disabled in /var/www/html/mailscanner/conf.php for
backward compatibility.  However, doing so reduces the security of the
system.  The security problem is that domain admins have the ability to
elevate and downgrade privileges of other admins and domain admins.

################ Important Info -- Custom Tweaks ######################

Many EFA users have modified their EFA installations and made tweaks
that may "disappear" after an update to 3.0.2.6.

Updated files have been automatically backed up to the following
location:

/var/EFA/backup/

(Other versions may be present if updating from an older version)

Users who had prior 3rd party certs in-place on eFa 3.0.2.4 or lower
are overridden by the upgrade to eFa 3.0.2.6. This is due to the 
regeneration of the self-signed cert. After the upgrade, and if you
were using a 3rd party cert, please make sure to update your paths 
accordingly for Postfix and Apache to reflect the original paths.
Future updates beyond 3.0.2.6 will leave exisitng cert paths alone,
pending no major security tweaks required to secure systems. 

########################## Known Issues ###############################

1)  If you are running commercial VMware-Tools, open-vm-tools may
install itself after updating to 3.0.2.6.  Reapply VMware-Tools
after updating to 3.0.2.6.  Run the following command to remove
open-vm-tools:

sudo rpm -e open-vm-tools

2) If you updated from versions prior to 3.0.2.5, manual intervention
for clamav-unofficial-sigs may be necessary. Examine 
/etc/clamav-unofficial-sigs and update conf files.
If rpmnew files are present, move your customizations (if any) to them.
and replace the old conf files.  For example:

mv /etc/clamav-unofficial-sigs/master.conf /etc/clamav-unofficial-sigs/master.conf.old
mv /etc/clamav-unofficial-sigs/master.conf.rpmnew /etc/clamav-unofficial-sigs/master.conf
